;; #project-persist-drawer
;; Use a project drawer with [project-persist](https://github.com/rdallasgray/project-persist).
;; 
;; ## Adaptors
;; At present only one adaptor is available --
;; [project-persist-drawer-adaptor-sr-speedbar](https://github.com/rdallasgray/project-persist-drawer-adaptor-sr-speedbar),
;; which uses [sr-speedbar](https://github.com/emacsmirror/sr-speedbar)
;; to display the project drawer.
;; 
;; An adaptor must implement the following functions:
;; ```elisp
;; (eval-after-load 'project-persist-drawer
;;   '(progn
;;     (defun project-persist-drawer-get-window ()
;;       "Return the window associated with the project drawer.")
;; 
;;     (defun project-persist-drawer-open (dir)
;;       "Open the project drawer in DIR.")
;; 
;;     (defun project-persist-drawer-before-open (dir)
;;       "Function run before the drawer is opened in DIR.")
;; 
;;     (defun project-persist-drawer-after-open (dir)
;;       "Function run after the drawer is opened in DIR.")))
;; ```
;; 
;; The function declarations should be wrapped in an `eval-after-load` block to ensure project-persist-drawer is loaded first.
